0.6.0 Changelog
 - Now removes the top ribbon (the one that slides down the entire Pandora UI)
 - Bug fix

0.5.9 Changelog
 - Added (optional) "Configure PandoraEnhancer" link in Pandora's header. I use Pandora as an application shortcut, so there's no Omnibar icon to bring the config up. Problem solved.

0.5.8.1 Changelog

0.5.8 Changelog
 - Skips "Are you still listening?" dialog
 - Removes "helpful" tooltips
 - All options are configurable
 - Customizable notification display length
 - Song change detection dramatically improved
 - Selectable lyrics functionality improved

0.5.7 Changelog:
 - New versioning
 - Uses default Pandora background image (instead of a flat color)
 - Song Change Notifications - use Pandora in the background (like me)? New notification pops up in a user-definable spot on your screen for a few seconds with info about the current song. To configure positioning, click the little wrench icon on the notification.
 ** Note that Song Change Notifications will NOT work if Chrome is minimized. Just keep Pandora open in the background. This is being looked into.
 - Code changes to make adding new features simpler.

0.0.5.6 Changelog:
 - Selectable lyrics! You can now select lyrics to copy onto your clipboard. Or...
 - Copy all lyrics! Easily copy the entire lyrics of a song (if lyrics are available)

 - Removes promobox (under station listing)
 - Extends station listing to the bottom
